# HvZ (Human Vs Zombies)

This repository contains the React application for the web based Java Spring game application called HvZ.
The project is the final case for Experis Academy's accelerated Fullstack Java graduate program. 
Detailed description of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/godlikecpu/HvZ-backend/blob/main/docs/HvZ%20Case.pdf).

## Game description

Humans vs. Zombies (HvZ) is a game of tag played at schools, camps, neighborhoods, libraries, and conventions around the world. 
The game simulates the exponential spread of a fictional zombie infection through a population.

More about the rules of the game is available at the official website [Humans vs. Zombies](https://humansvszombies.org)

## Technology stack 

<b>Framework:</b>
  - React - version 17.0.1
 
<b>Important Library:</b>
  - React Leaflet - version 3.1.0

## Deployment
The React application is deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
Link to the application on Vercel is [here](https://hvz-frontend-dkjv7crmi-dxcr.vercel.app).

## Interactive map
[Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) is an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org) provides bindings between React and Leaflet. It does not replace Leaflet, but leverages it to abstract Leaflet layers as React components.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
